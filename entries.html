            <h1>Damn. Here I am again on another "thing I learned" page</h1>
            <div class='line1'></div>
            <p> Oh look, you stumbled across one of the most generic articles you can come across on the internet.
                 Let me guess. Early to late 20’s? Still don’t know what the fuck is going on with your life, or what will happen in your life?
                  That’s okay me too dude, but I’m guessing you must of clicked this article for a reason right? That whole determinism concept you probably forgot about in your college philosophy class
                   is probably slapping you right in the head right now. Whether it is an act of philosophy or not, you’re here to get a good read,
                    so I made this article for lost assholes like you and I to read and hopefully apply in our lives.
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>You don’t really know shit….and that’s okay.</h2>
            <p>To be honest, at the age of 27, I feel like I got this whole adulting shit figured out, which was the same idiotic thought I had when I was 21. 
                And, at the age of 37, I’m probably going to say the same shit over again, and again, and again. My point?  
                I can say that I know how shit works, but the reality is I don’t know what I’m doing.
                 When I decided to leave my family to try and venture out on my own. I had no idea what kind of a wallop I was in for.
                  From unexpected bills, accidents, lots of self doubt, multiple mental health adversities is just the tip of the iceberg.
                   But, even though I didn’t really know shit going into it, and still don’t know shit now, It’s okay. 
                   Don’t ever expect to have your life figured out by 20 or 30, hell, even later in life. I still feel like my parents are still trying to figure shit out,
                    and here I am with multiple problems while trying to keep a fucking smile.
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>You’re not going to keep all your friends. So stop trying to please everyone.</h2>
            <p >Remember in highschool, when you made a promise to all your friends that you guys would always kick it and be friends forever?
                 Reality check boys and girls that shit does not happen. You will lose of a bunch of friends over time.
                  I’m not trying to be a negative person or anything. It’s just when life kicks in ( and by life I mean: obligations, work, school, family.. 
                  You know the time consuming shit that you’re obligated to do.) time becomes a huge value, and spending the time with people that matter is in the upmost importance. 
                  Don’t spend your time trying to please everyone. Be happy with the significant people in your life right now. 
                  They may play a vital role the more time and effort you put into the relationship. With time playing a big factor during adulthood; 
                  its valuable to me that you atleast have one friend that means a lot to you; and that could be a difference between life and death..

            <h2 class='fade-in'>Find someone that’s good for your soul.</h2>
            <p>I have been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years now. Time and time again, she always seems to find a way to level me and touch my soul.
                 From flying out monthly, to just actually listen to me about the dumbest shit that no one cares about.
                  If you can find someone that is actually good for you, and no I’m not talking about the crazy girl that you met in the club with daddy issues,
                   but a woman who listens to every fiber of your being. Someone you’re not afraid to speak openly about anything. Someone that will support you through your trials and tribulations,
                    because those qualities are something that withstand time. 
            </p>
            <div class='wrapper'>

            </div>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>If circumstances are possible...move.</h2>
            <p>Personally, I think moving had to have been the best and the worst move I have ever done. It’s a trade off that may change you for the better or worse.
                 Knowing that you have a clean slate, but no connections and how you handle the circumstances in your life with those factors is what makes moving to a new place worth it. 
                 It challenged me to figure out life without a handicap; forging friendships, and relationships, and making moves to sustain this new life from scratch. 
                 There were many ups and downs during this process. But, overall, the experience truly made me cherish the relationships that I have now and previously had with friends back home. 
                 It humbled me about my knowledge of cultures and how I perceived the world. It blessed me with opportunity and cursed me with adversity. 
                 If I went back in time to change my thought of moving, I wouldn’t. It truly changed me for the better. 
            <h2 class='fade-in'>Don’t stress so hard about not meeting your goals you made.</h2>
            <p>When I was in highschool, I told myself that I would be in a band touring the world, get married, get a house, and have life figured out by my mid 20’s.
                 I literally did like 1 ½ of those goals. Can you guess which? That’s right, I got in a band and didn’t get far with it. Do I regret it? No. 
                 I don’t even think I am even close to meeting my goals, but am I upset about it? No. The whole point of your life is to figure it out as you go. 
                 Goals are not always meant to be completed in a timely fashion, and some goals are never meant to be completed at all. 
                 It’s the journey of how you get to the end resolution of your life that matters, not the destination. 
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>Your parents are people too.</h2>
            <p>Parental figures that you’ve grown up with aren’t always going to be you’re parents. Like everything that lives, their time will come too. 
                Growing up, I always saw my parents as these figures of authority. But, when around my 20’s, I started to realize that they didn’t have all the answers, 
                and that they are just like me. Just trying to get by and figure shit out. When I started to actually treat them as people, and not parents, 
                my relationship with them dramatically improved. I’m not saying you should go and talk about the one night stand you had to your parents, but talk to them about life, 
                and things you find interesting. They’re not stupid, or will tell you to fuck off or anything, and if they do,
                 at least you know you tried making a relationship with your parents rather than living your entire life asking what if?   
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>Don’t live your parents dream.</h2>
            <p>Look, I know I just said earlier to stop treating your parents are parental figures in the last section, but too add to it, DO NOT LIVE YOUR PARENTS DREAM. 
                By that, I mean figure your own life out. I went into nursing thinking that it would be good for me. You know. Stable job, health insurance, a way for you me to flex that I had a career.
                 But, after 5 years of working medical. I realized it’s not what I wanted. It didn’t make me happy, and my mother just kept telling me to stick with it. But,
                  I didn’t want to keep coming into a job that I didn’t like for the rest of my life. I felt like I was living a dream that my parents wanted, and my own happiness was suffering for it.
                   I find it important to find something that you actually give a shit about, because no amount of money will ever be able to buy your happiness. 
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>Find peace in silence.</h2>
            <p>Being a natural introvert, I find it a necessity to have more moments to myself than with others. I feel that having time to yourself ( and I mean literally no social media, or internet) is vital.
                 When you have time to yourself, it gives you time to reflect on your life, and what you want out of it, what you need to do to get to it, what you value, and what you don’t.
                  I advise to not spend too much time a lone as it results in overthinking in my experience. But, if possible, 
                  please take the time to give yourself sometime to find yourself. 
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>Time > Money.</h2>
            <p>I’ll keep this one short and simple. You can always get money back, but you can never get time back.    
            </p>
            <h2 class='fade-in'>The most important part of all. Fuck what I have to say!</h2>
            <p>If you’re going to take anything at all from this list, it should be this. You don’t have to listen to anything that I have to say in regards to your own life.
                 Take initiative and find what works for you. You don’t need me, or some other random person that knows how to create a blog to tell you what is right and what is wrong.
                  The beautiful part of life, and not just your 20’s, or 30’s, is that it’s a game where there are no copies. You determine the value, experience, and the total end game of your life, 
                  and a blog (should you choose to follow it) or any other source of self help should not tell you the success to a great life because they are not you.
